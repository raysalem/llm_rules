# Repository Documentation Structure

## Segregation of Rules vs. Project State
- `.cursor/rules/` defines **HOW** the AI behaves (logic, style, constraints).
- `docs/` contains **WHAT** the project is (state, architecture, roadmap). 
- Never store session-specific state in the rules folder.

## Required Documents
The following structure is the project's "Long-Term Memory." All docs MUST live in the `docs/` folder (except the root `README.md`).

1. `README.md` (Root) - High-level overview of the project, setup instructions, and quick start guide.
2. `docs/detailed.md` - In-depth technical architecture, data flow, and complex logic (e.g., anti-bot strategies). should leverage the source folder details files and avoid overlap. shoudl use links accordingly.
3. `docs/features.md` - list of existing features plus the asociated verifcation for each said feature. critical succinct list to be used for future development
4. `docs/todo.md` - Active bug list, technical debt, and future enhancements. can also include pending features. needs tracking 
5. `docs/plan.md` - **Mandatory** active execution plan for the current task.
6. `docs/requirements.md` - Third-party dependencies, system requirements, and environment setup details.

## Doc Maintenance Rules
- **Consistency**: Keep `README.md` in sync with `docs/features.md`.
- **heiachry**: all source folder should have a top level details.md file that gives a high level overview of the folder and its contents. the name shoudl be the name of the parent folder. 
- **SOP Adherence**: Every session begins by reading the `docs/` folder and `README.md`.
- **Updates**: Every completed task must conclude with an update to the relevant documentation files.
