# Web Scraping Guidelines

## Best Practices
- **Tools**: Prefer Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, Selenium, Playwright, or Requests based on the task complexity.
- **Robustness**: Build resiliency. Implement request rate-limiting and backoff strategies to avoid IP bans (e.g., 1 request per second minimum).
- **Edge Cases**: Always address handling for Cloudflare/bot protection mechanisms and complex navigation logic (like pagination). 
- **Parsing**: Handle DOM changes gracefully with explicit data validation and checks on scraped items before passing them to the pipeline.
